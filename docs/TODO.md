● 🔍 Identified Refactoring Opportunities and Inconsistencies

  Here's what I found after a thorough review:

  🎯 Major Inconsistencies Found:

  1. Missing Template Support

  Several commands display blocks but don't support the --template flag:

  - filter command: Uses hardcoded DetailedFormatter and verbose_details boolean instead of template system
  - mesh-diff command: Uses hardcoded CompactFormatter
  - rename command: Uses hardcoded CompactFormatter
  - diff command: Uses hardcoded formatters in diff_formatter.rs

  2. Inconsistent Flag Patterns

  - filter has --verbose-details flag instead of using template system
  - mesh-diff has --verbose-provenance but no display template control
  - Some commands have --show-data (blocks, dependencies) while others don't

  3. Hardcoded Formatter Usage

  Multiple places still use hardcoded formatters instead of the centralized template system:
  - commands/filter.rs:109-114
  - commands/mesh_diff.rs:46, 116
  - commands/rename.rs:42
  - diff_formatter.rs:148, 175, 210

  🔧 Recommended Refactors (in priority order):

  Priority 1 - Critical Inconsistency:

  Add --template support to filter command
  - Replace --verbose-details with --template flag
  - Use create_display_for_template() helper
  - This would make filter consistent with blocks/dependencies

  Priority 2 - Moderate Inconsistency:

  Add --template support to commands that display blocks:
  - mesh-diff command (shows block names)
  - rename command (shows target block info)

  Priority 3 - Minor Cleanup:

  Standardize diff formatter to use template system
  - Update diff_formatter.rs to accept template parameter
  - Replace hardcoded CompactFormatter usage

  Priority 4 - Consider Adding:

  --show-data flag consistency
  - Consider if filter and other commands should have --show-data flag

  🎉 What's Already Good:

  - ✅ No build warnings
  - ✅ Clean import organization after refactoring
  - ✅ Centralized template logic in block_display.rs
  - ✅ Consistent descriptions for all commands
  - ✅ Good separation of concerns

  🚀 Biggest Impact Fix:

  The filter command template support would be the most impactful fix since:
  1. It's a user-facing inconsistency (different flag pattern)
  2. Filter is likely used frequently
  3. It currently has its own --verbose-details flag that duplicates template functionality

  Would you like me to implement any of these refactors, starting with the filter command template support?
